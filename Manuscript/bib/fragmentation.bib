	abstract = {This work is aimed to study the mechanical properties of basalt fibers, and their adhesion to polypropylene (PP) matrices. Single filament tensile tests were used to calculate the strength of different types of fibers, characterized by different providers and surface treatment. Single fiber fragmentation tests (SFFT) were used to calculate the critical length of the fibers, in a homopolymer PP matrix and in a maleic anhydride modified PP matrix. It was shown that the tensile strength of the fibers is not significantly influenced by the origin or the surface treatment. Only fibers without any sizing show very reduced mechanical properties. On the other hand, the tensile strength was shown to be severely dependent on the filament length. Weibull theory was used in order to calculate the fitting parameters σ0 and β, which were necessary in order to extrapolate the tensile strength to the critical length determined by SFFT. This allowed calculating the adhesion properties of the basalt fibers. It was shown that fiber–matrix adhesion is dependent on both the presence of sizing on the fiber surface, as well as on the modification of the matrix.},

	abstract = {The recent development of inorganic based composites as low-cost materials in reinforced concrete structural strengthening and precast thin-walled components, requires the creation of models that predict the mechanical behaviour of these materials.
	
	Textile Reinforced Mortar (TRM) shows complex stress–strain behaviour in tension derived from the heterogeneity of its constituent materials. This complexity is mainly caused by the formation of several cracks in the inorganic matrix. The multiple cracking leads to a decrease in structural stiffness. Due to the severe conditions of the serviceability limit state in structural elements, the prediction of the stress–strain curve is essential for design and calculation purposes. After checking other models, an empirical nonlinear approach, which is based on the crack control expression included in the Eurocode 2, is proposed in this paper.
	
	Following this scope, this paper presents an experimental campaign focused on 31 TRM specimens reinforced with four different reinforcing ratios. The results are analysed and satisfactorily contrasted with the presented non-linear approach.},

	abstract = {The use of composite materials for repair and retrofit of structures has become a common use among the engineering community. Fabric Reinforced Cementitious Matrix (FRCM) is a composite material specifically designed for masonry and concrete rehabilitation and is becoming a viable alternative to FRP, whenever the project conditions do not allow the use of organic polymer based composites. FRCM is usually constituted by one or multiple plies of dry fabrics (carbon, glass, aramid, basalt or PBO fibers) embedded into an inorganic matrix. If a polymer is used to either cover or bond the fabric strands, such polymer does not fully penetrate and impregnate the fibers as it would for FRP. The purpose of this research work is to study how different types and amounts of organic coatings applied to a carbon fabric could affect the bond behavior between fabric and mortar. The effectiveness of coating treatments was studied by means of direct tensile, pull-off and shear-bond double-lap tests. Experimentation was carried out on different combinations of fabrics and mortars, by varying the levels of pre-impregnation of the fabric during its manufacturing. In addition, the use of a quartz sand layer applied to the fabric after impregnation was investigated. Experimental evidence shows a promising enhancement of the bond between fabric and matrix and, therefore, of the entire system even with the use of low percentages of resin, depending on the type of mortar used.},

Detailed results show that with increasing the weight percentage of SWCNT, fracture toughness improves. Three situations of nanotube directions with respect to crack are considered.

In addition, it can be seen that the crack resistance improves by increasing the length and chirality for all kinds of nanotubes.

The high strain rates ranging from 25 to 100 s(-1) were achieved using a high speed servo-hydraulic testing machine. Image analysis by means of digital image correlation (DIC) method was used to obtain the evolution of crack width which was subsequently correlated with stress response. The non-uniform strain distribution was characterized as three distinct response zones of localization, shear lag, and uniform strain and quantitatively measured in each zone. Mechanism corresponding to the basic aspects of tension stiffening modeling were identified by computing the average stress in the matrix phase between two cracks. The width of crack localization zone as well as crack spacing were also obtained using DIG as indications of bonding properties. A finite difference method simulating tension stiffening behavior was employed to predict crack spacing and stress-strain responses of TRC systems. Improvements in bond properties and mitigation of cracking with the addition of short fibers were verified using multiple methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	issn = {0889-325X},
	abstract = {The size effect on the nominal strength of quasibrittle structures failing at crack initiation, and particularly on the modulus of rupture of plain concrete beams, is analyzed. First, an improved deterministic formula is derived from the energy release due to a boundary layer of cracking (initiating fracture process zone) whose thickness is not negligible compared to beam depth. To fit the test data, a rapidly converging iterative nonlinear optimization algorithm is developed. The formula is shown to give an excellent agreement with the existing test data on the size effect on the modulus of rupture of plain concrete beams. The data range, however, is much too limited; it does not cover the extreme sizes encountered in arch dams, foundations, and retaining walls. Therefore, it becomes necessary to extrapolate on the basis of a theory. For extreme sizes, the Weibull type statistical effect of random material strength must be incorporated into the theory. Based on structural analysis with the recently developed statistical nonlocal model, a generalized energetic-statistical size effect formula is developed. The formula represents asymptotic matching between the deterministic-energetic formula, which is approached for small sizes, and the power law size effect of the classical Weibull theory, which is approached for large sizes. In the limit of infinite Weibull modulus, the deterministic-energetic formula is recovered. Data fitting with the new formula reveals that, for concrete and mortar, the Weibull modulus m approximate to 24 rather than 12, the value widely accepted so far. This means that, for extreme sizes, the nominal strength (modulus of rupture) decrease, for two-dimensional similarity, as th -1/12 power of the structure size, and for three-dimensional similarity, as the -1/8 power (whereas the -1/4 power has been assumed thus far). The coefficient of variation characterizing the scatter of many test results for one shape and one size is shown not to give the correct value of Weibull modulus because the energetic size effect inevitably intervenes. The results imply that the size effect at fracture initiation must have been a significant contributing factor in many disasters (for example, those of Malpasset Dam, Saint Francis Dam, and Schoharie Creek Bridge).},

In this paper an alternative approach to evaluate the tensile performance of SHCC is investigated. The behavior of the material in tension is studied at the level of a single crack. The derived tensile stress-crack opening behavior is utilized to analyze and compare the influence of various composite parameters on the resulting tensile behavior.

In organic fillers, the improvement was attributed largely to good filling and the ability of the polymer to bind all the filaments within the bundle to form a single unit, such that the load is efficiently carried by all the filaments.

	abstract = {This article focus on modelling of ageing effects on crack-bridging behaviour of AR-glass multifilament yarns embedded in cement-based matrix. In the first step, age-dependent changes in the crack-bridging behaviour of AR-glass multifilament yarns were investigated at the meso and micro levels. Two cementitious matrices were considered where the binder contained Portland cement clinker and ground granulated blast furnace slag cement, respectively. Mechanical characteristics of the bond between matrix and multifilament yarns after accelerated ageing were measured by means of double-sided yarn pullout tests. In these tests the multifilament yarns bridged a single crack in the matrix arising in a notched area of the specimen. Losses in performance with increasing age differed widely depending on matrix material composition. The essential cause of such losses was discovered to be the microscopic densification of the fibre-to-matrix interface. This led to increased bond intensity and restricted slip-ability of the filaments. Subsequently, these micro-structural phenomena were related to the mesoscopic material behaviour by means of a phenomenological bond model. This cross-linkage model describes the crack-bridging effect of the entire multifilament yarn at the single filament level. According to the model, each filament possesses a specific deformation length depending on its position in the cross-section of the yarn. This deformation length depends on bond characteristics between single filament and cementitious matrix, which vary with age. Characteristic values of the model were computed from load-crack width curves obtained from the yarn pullout tests. The changes in the microstructure were represented by the characteristic values of the model.},

The energy criterion indicates that the crack spacing is a function of the axial strain of the bars and also depends on bar spacing, bar diameter, fracture energy of concrete, and its elastic modulus. Both the energy and strength criteria yield a minimum strain necessary to produce any cracks. The energy criterion and the bond slip conditions further yield a lower bound on possible spacing of continuous cracks. The rules for the formation of shorter, partial length, cracks are also set up. Approximate expressions for the crack width at, and away, from the bars are derived. Numerical comparisons indicate satisfactory agreement with existing test data, and lend theoretical support to one aspect of the empirical Gergely‐Lutz formula obtained by statistical regression analysis of test data.

Common tensile test machines damage the yarns initially or prematurely due to non-uniform load introduction which causes stress concentrations. As a result, the theoretical yarn strength (perfectly clamped filaments at a unique length and no initial damage) is underestimated. With the new clamp adapter, higher strengths close to the theoretical values can be measured since the adapter largely eliminates the problems with non-uniform load introduction. A test series comparing yarns strengths tested with the clamp adapter and with commonly used test methods has been performed and the results are discussed in this paper. Furthermore, they are compared with theoretical values using the Daniels’ fibre-bundle model.},

The stress transfer between neighboring filaments causes reactivation of a broken filament at some distance from the break. The utilized statis-tical bundle models predict a change in the slope of the mean size effect curve once the stress transfer length becomes longer than the specimen length. This fact can be exploited for determining the stress transfer length indirectly using the yarn tensile test with appropriately chosen test lengths. The identification procedure is demonstrated using two test series of tensile tests with {AR-glass} and carbon yarns.},

The key point of this approach lies in the identification and validation at both local and macroscopic scales. Thus, in addition to macroscopic tensile tests, the evolution of microscopic damage mechanisms – in the form of matrix cracks and fiber breaks – is experimentally analyzed and quantified through in-situ scanning electron microscope and computed tomography tensile tests. A complete model, including both matrix cracking and fiber breaking, is proposed on the basis of existing modeling tools separately addressing these mechanisms. It is based on matrix and fiber failure probability laws and a stress redistribution assumption in the vicinity of matrix cracks or fiber breaks. The identification of interfacial parameters is conducted to fit the experimental characterization, and shows that conventional assumptions of 1D probabilistic models can adequately describe matrix cracking at both macro- and microscopic scales. However, it is necessary to enrich them to get a proper prediction of ultimate failure and fiber break density for Hi-Nicalon type S fiber-reinforced {SiC}/{SiC} minicomposites.},

Here, a new H embrittlement mechanism operating at the atomic scale in α-iron is demonstrated. Direct molecular dynamics simulations reveal a ductile-to-brittle transition caused by the suppression of dislocation emission at the crack tip due to aggregation of H, which then permits brittle-cleavage failure followed by slow crack growth. The atomistic embrittlement mechanism is then connected to material states and loading conditions through a kinetic model for H delivery to the crack-tip region. Parameter-free predictions of embrittlement thresholds in Fe-based steels over a range of H concentrations, mechanical loading rates and H diffusion rates are found to be in excellent agreement with experiments. This work provides a mechanistic, predictive framework for interpreting experiments, designing structural components and guiding the design of embrittlement-resistant materials.},

A concurrent multiscale molecular dynamics – continuum simulation framework is employed. The results are then interpreted using a Peierls continuum model that uses finite temperature material properties derived from molecular dynamics simulation. Under ramped loading, partial dislocation nucleation at the crack tip is found to lead to both full dislocation emission and twinning, depending upon the orientation, temperature, and magnitude of the applied load in the simulation. The origins of the dependencies are made apparent by the Peierls continuum model. The continuum model suggests that in many instances dislocation nucleation from the crack tip can be considered to be a strain rate independent process, yet still temperature dependent through the temperature dependence of the stacking fault energies and elastic constants.

By employing a recent interatomic potential and the Nudged Elastic Band method, we predict the atomistic saddle-point state of 1 / 2 〈 111 〉 screw dislocation motion in \{BCC\} iron that involves the nucleation of correlated kinkpairs and the resulting double superkinks. This unique process leads to a single-humped minimum energy path that governs the one-step activation of a screw dislocation to move into the adjacent { 110 } Peierls valley, which contrasts with the double-humped energy path and the two-step transition predicted by other interatomic potentials. Based on transition state theory, we use the atomistically computed, stress-dependent kinkpair activation parameters to inform a coarse-grained crystal plasticity flow rule. Our atomistically-informed crystal plasticity model quantitatively predicts the orientation dependent stress–strain behavior of \{BCC\} iron single crystals in a manner that is consistent with experimental results. The predicted temperature and strain-rate dependencies of the yield stress agree with experimental results in the 200–350&#xa0;K temperature regime, and are rationalized by the small activation volumes associated with the kinkpair-mediated motion of screw dislocations.

   pavilion is being realized with a roof construction made of textile
   reinforced concrete (TRC), a composite material consisting of a
   high-strength, fine grained concrete and a noncorroding textile
   reinforcement. The thin-walled TRC-shell structure demonstrates
   impressively the load-bearing capacity of this innovative composite
   material. The present contribution discusses the dimensioning approach
   for TRC-shell structures and the numerical evaluation based on

The calibration of the model to a target non-Gaussian process may require iterations. The Ito⁁ formula is used to calculate higher-order moments of the proposed model. These moments can be used to tune the model such that it matches some of the higher-order moments of a target non-Gaussian process in addition to its second-moment properties.

Maleic anhydride polypropylene ({MAPP)} was used as a compatibilizer to improve the adhesion between the reinforcements and the matrix material. By incorporating up to 20\% (by mass) glass fiber, the tensile and flexural modulus of {BGRP} were increased by 12.5 and 10\%, respectively; and the tensile and flexural strength were increased by 7 and 25\%, respectively, compared to those of {BFRP.} Sorption behavior and effects of environmental aging on tensile properties of both {BFRP} and {BGRP} systems were studied by immersing samples in water for up to 1200 h at 25 {degreesC.} Compared to {BFRP}, a 4\% drop in saturated moisture level is seen in {BGRP.} After aging in water for 1200 h, reduction in tensile strength and modulus for {BGRP} is nearly two times less than that of {BFRP.} Use of {MAPP} as
coupling agent in the polypropylene matrix results in decreased saturated moisture absorption level and enhanced mechanical properties for both {BFRP} and {BGRP} systems. Thus it is shown that the durability of bamboo fiber reinforced polypropylene can be enhanced by hybridization with small amount of glass fibers. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A {THEoRY} is presented to predict the ultimate tensile strength of brittle matrix composites as a function of underlying material parameters, and specifically to investigate the origin of the tough to brittle transition often observed in these materials as the fiber-matrix interfacial sliding resistance tau is increased. The theory relaxes the usual assumption of global load sharing of the load transfer from broken to unbroken fibers in the composite [{CURTIN}, W.A., J. Am. Ceram. Soc. 74, 2837 (1991)] by taking the load to be equally distributed among only N(f) fibers around a broken fiber (local load sharing). The composite is then modeled as a collection of independent fiber bundles with Nf fibers per bundle, and composite failure occurs when the weakest bundle fails. Composite strength is thus controlled by the strength distribution of size-N(f) bundles, which is calculated here by analytical and simulation techniques. As N(f) --{\textgreater} infinity the global load sharing results for
composite strengths are regained, but significant composite strength degradation is predicted for bundle sizes N(f) less-than-or-equal-to 100. An ansatz relating N(f) to material parameters is then proposed and calculations of the strengths of C-Nicalon composites agree well with experiment. Model calculations on a Nicalon-{LAS} glass composite show that local load sharing effects lead to a tough to brittle transition between 100 and 200 {MPa}, much lower than predicted by the global load sharing theory although still larger than found experimentally.},

The book synthesizes a vast number of recent research results in the literature to provide a comprehensive treatment of the topic that does not give merely the facts - it provides true understanding. The many recent results on quasibrittle fracture and size effect, which were scattered throughout many periodicals, are compiled here in a single volume. This book presents a well-rounded discussion of the theory of size effect and scaling of failure loads in structures. The size effect, which is the most important practical manifestation of fracture behavior, has become a hot topic. It has gained prominence in current research on concrete and quasibrittle materials. The treatment of every subject in Fracture and Size Effect in Concrete and Other Quasibrittle Materials proceeds from simple to complex, from
specialized to general, and is as concise as possible using the simplest level of mathematics necessary to treat the subject clearly and accurately. Whether you are an engineering student or a practicing engineer, this book provides you with a clear presentation, including full derivations and examples, from which you can gain real understanding of fracture and size effect in concrete and other quasibrittle materials.},

A major contribution to the work of fracture is the work to pull-out broken fibers from the matrix against the sliding resistance. Recent analytic theories of the pull-out predict finite pull-out for very narrow fiber strength distributions, in contrast to prior theories and ideas suggesting zero pull-out. The theories also assume that fiber cracking is distributed throughout the composite and not localized to some narrow region; such strain localization could modify composite properties tremendously. Here, both analytical arguments and numerical simulations are used to show that finite pull-out does exist for narrow fiber strength distributions. The
numerical simulations also demonstrate that strain localization does occur, but that it (i) does not affect the ultimate tensile strength, and (ii) reduces pull-out only slightly but with the detailed trends in pull-out properties predicted by the analytic theory retained. Some basic tenets and results of the analytic models are thus robust and so the analytic models should serve as powerful tools for composite optimization.},

Current models assume hexagonal or square fibre packings. In the present work, random fibre packings were modelled using {3D} finite element analysis and compared to ordered fibre packings. Significant differences in the stress redistribution are found. Compared to square and hexagonal packings, random fibre packings result in smaller stress concentration factors for fibres at the same distance from the broken fibre. These random packings, however, also show higher maximal stress concentration factors. The influence of the fibre breakage is more localised, which results in lower ineffective and overload lengths. The presence of fibres at smaller distances from the broken fibre explains these phenomena. For an accurate representation of the stress redistribution after a fibre breakage, random fibre packings should be used.},

In this study an analytical model is derived which allows the calculation of a load displacement distribution of a pull-out test on basis of a general mathematical description on the bond stress versus slip relation, assuming a N-piecewise linear bond law with no limitation of N.

The variation of pull-out stress with embedded length is caused by the decrease of the frictional stress due to the Poisson contraction of the wire under tensile stress. The effect of wire contraction on the friction process was confirmed by using different initial wire tensions. The residual compressive stress at the interface due to resin shrinkage and the coefficient of friction were determined from the analysis of the pull-out process.},

Using this technique, composite reliability, the influence of manufacturing defects on performance, and the overall optimization of composite performance can all be investigated in detail. Initial results using this approach show that load transfer and the existence of spatially-staggered fiber breaks play an important role in determining strength and toughness of composites. Furthermore, the critical configurations of fiber breaks that initiate catastrophic failure are complicated {3D} objects and any single
spatial plane is composed mainly of sliding fibers rather than broken fibers, with a few strong fibers intact within the critical defect.},

	abstract = {Exact equations are derived governing the evolution of fiber fragments in a Weibull fiber loaded according to the “single filament composite test”. These equations differ from those formulated by others who have made a priori assumptions on the shape of the fragment distribution that are shown to be incorrect. An explicit closed form solution of the governing equations is derived for arbitrary Weibull modulus ϱ and for random initial breaks with exponentially distributed spacings of a given normalised rate α along the fiber. In particular, the special case of unique fiber strength (ϱ = ∞), which is adapted from an exact solution of Widom [J. Chem. Phys. 44, 3888–3894 (1966)], is a limiting case of our solution. Furthermore, the solution for the case of ϱ = 0 can be expressed in terms of elementary functions. The limiting distribution function for normalised fragment length is also obtained in closed form for all ϱ ⩾ 0. The convergence of this distribution function to that for the case of unique
fiber strength, where the normalised fragment lengths x lie between 12 and 1, is very slow being O(ϱ−12). For finite ϱ the lower tail asymptotics of the limiting distribution function are proportional to (2x)2ϱ + 1, x ⩾ 0, so that a Weibull plot there has a slope of 2ϱ + 1. In fact, in the limit as ϱ → 0, the normalised fragment length follows an exponential distribution, which turns out to be a good approximation for 0 ⩽ ϱ \&lt; 1. We apply our closed form solution to the study of the strength of large fiber-reinforced ceramic composites. The ultimate strength of such composites is obtained in closed form for all ϱ. Expressions are given in terms of elementary functions which allow computation of the composite ultimate strength μ∗ to any degree of accuracy. Our results show that the composite strength μ∗ is unique and occurs at a bounded dimensionless stress s∗ for all ϱ \&gt; 0, contrary to assertions made by others. In particular, s∗ is estimated to within 2\% by the formula s∗ = [6(1 − √ 1 − 23ϱ)]1(1 + ϱ)
 for ϱ ⩾ 1, and we also give excellent approximations for general ϱ \&gt; 0.},

	abstract = {A new approach to experimental data treatment in the pull-out and microbond tests has been developed. It uses the relationship between the maximum force recorded in these tests and the embedded length ('scale factor') to separately determine adhesional interfacial parameters (critical energy release rate, local bond strength) and interfacial friction in debonded regions. The new method does not require the measurement of the debond force, which corresponds to interfacial crack initiation, and is, therefore, much more convenient and simpler than 'direct' techniques involving continuous monitoring of crack growth. Using the equation for the current crack length as a function of the load applied to the fiber, based on a fracture mechanics analysis of interfacial debonding, we modeled the pull-out and microbond experiments and obtained the maximum force versus the embedded length. By varying the critical energy release rate and interfacial frictional stress to fit experimental plots, both
interfacial parameters were determined for several fiber-polymer pairs. Effects of specimen geometry, residual thermal stresses, and interfacial friction on the measured values are discussed. The results are compared with those obtained with our similar stress-based approach. The energy criterion works when the embedded length is not very short, and in this range of embedded length it is better than the stress criterion. Both criteria can be complementarily used for interface characterization.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the effects of size (both length and width) on the probability distribution for strength of a composite consisting of brittle fibers aligned in a brittle matrix. The failure process involves quasi-periodic matrix cracking, frictional sliding of the fibers in fiber break zones, and fiber bridging of matrix cracks in a global load-sharing framework. The fiber strength follows the usual Poisson-Weibull model of random flaws along the length. We first consider a composite cross-section, and develop the probability distribution for its strength in terms of certain characteristic fiber strength and length scales and the number of fibers in the cross-section. This strength distribution turns out to be a Gaussian distribution. We also calculate refined estimates of its mean and standard deviation, taking advantage of some new results based on an exact closed form solution for fragmentation of fibers in a single filament composite. We then consider the strength of a composite having
a length orders of magnitude greater than the characteristic fiber length. We develop predictions for the scaling of the strength vs composite length based on certain results from the statistical theory of extremes in Gaussian processes. For this we develop an estimate of the covariance between the strengths of two nearby cross-sections of the composite. We also develop results based on a weakest-link analysis in terms of composite links of a certain length somewhat shorter than the characteristic fiber length. We then favorably compare our analytical results to numerical results from a Monte Carlo simulation of the composite failure process. This Monte Carlo model is free of various assumptions made in the analysis. The comparison suggests that predictions of a composite strength are possible for composite lengths orders of magnitude beyond what Monte Carlo simulation programs can currently handle.

Continuous sections of the fibers follow the usual Weibull distribution for strength. We also introduce random discontinuities along the fiber, originating say from processing damage whose spacings follow a Poisson process where the rate alpha is the mean number of discontinuities per characteristic length of the fiber. We derive two approximations for the mean and standard deviation of such characteristic composites. A realistic Monte Carlo simulation model is developed to test these analytical
results and to study the fiber pull-out properties. The composites turn out to be quite insensitive to initial damage. The mean pull-out length is found to increase with increasing alpha and becomes independent of the Weibull modulus for large values of alpha.},

While such a classification seems deceptively simple, it was not arrived at spontaneously and took some time to materialize. This paper describes some chronological developments since the 1960’s and related nomenclature that led to the special class of strain-hardening {FRC} composites. These composites are characterized by a strain hardening response after first cracking accompanied by multiple cracking up to relatively high strains. Two different groups of researchers, one in the field of materials science and the other in civil engineering, working totally independently, formulated criteria to achieve such behavior. One criterion is based on a stress threshold and the other criterion is based on an energy balance. The two groups followed two entirely different approaches: one followed a composite mechanics
approach leading to a stress criterion, and one followed a fracture mechanics formulation leading to both a stress and an energy criterion. It is observed that the two groups while following entirely different paths solved in effect the same problem. Strain hardening {FRC} composites are expected to become widely used in the future in structural applications.},

The tests, carried out with controlled displacements, allow one to record complete load–deflection curves by means of which it is possible to deduce information on dissipative capacity and ductile behaviour up to failure. Depending on the amount of transverse reinforcement, volume fraction of fibres added in the mix and shear span, the collapse mechanism is due to predominant shear or flexure, thus showing the influence of the aforementioned structural parameters on the load carrying capacity and the post-peak behaviour of the beam. In particular, the results show that the inclusion of fibres in adequate percentage can change the brittle mode of failure characterizing shear collapse into a ductile flexural mechanism, confirming the possibility of achieving
analogous performance by using reinforcing fibres instead of increasing the amount of transverse reinforcement. The ultimate values of the shear stresses recorded experimentally are compared with the corresponding values deduced by semiempirical expressions available in the literature and the correlation is satisfactory.},

In general, pull-out loads and the pullout work increase with increasing roving cross-section, while the pull-out stress, the efficacy, and the roving penetration decrease. An attempt to separate the two geometrical factors revealed that an increase in the filament diameter reduced the mechanical performance of a roving to a much greater extent than an increase in the number of filaments.

	title = {Interfacial Mechanics in Fiber-Reinforced Composites: Mechanics of Single and Multiple Cracks in {CMCs}},
	abstract = {Several critical issues in the mechanics of the interface between the fibers and matrix in ceramic matrix composites ({CMCs)} are studied. The first issue is the competition between crack deflection and penetration at the fiber/matrix interface. When a matrix crack, the first fracture mode in a {CMC}, reaches the interface, two different crack modes are possible; crack deflection along the interface and crack penetration into the fibers. A criterion based on strain energy release rates is developed to determine the crack propagation at the interface. The Axisymmetric Damage Model ({ADM)}, a newly-developed numerical technique, is used to obtain the strain energy in the cracked composite. The results are compared with a commonly-used analytic solution provided by He and Hutchinson ({HH)}, and also with experimental data on a limited basis. The second issue is the stress distribution near the debond/sliding interface. If the interface is weak enough for the main matrix crack to deflect and form a
debond/sliding zone, then the stress distribution around the sliding interface is of interest because it provides insight into further cracking modes, i.e. multiple matrix cracking or possibly fiber failure. The stress distributions are obtained by the {ADM} and compared to a simple shear-lag model in which a constant sliding resistance is assumed. The results show that the matrix axial stress, which is responsible for further matrix cracking, is accurately predicted by the shear-lag model. Finally, the third issue is multiple matrix cracking. We present a theory to predict the stress/strain relations and unload/reload hysteresis behavior during the evolution of multiple matrix cracking. The random spacings between the matrix cracks as well as the crack interactions are taken into account in the model. The procedure to obtain the interfacial sliding resistance, thermal residual stress, and matrix flaw distribution from the experimental stress/strain data is discussed. The results are compared to a commonly-
used approach in which uniform crack spacings are assumed. Overall, we have considered various crack modes in the fiber reinforced {CMCs;} from a single matrix crack to multiple matrix cracking, and have suggested models to predict the microscopic crack behavior and to evaluate the macroscopic stress/strain relations. The damage tolerance or toughening due to the inelastic strains caused by matrix cracking phenomenon is the key issue of this study, and the interfacial mechanics in conjunction with the crack behavior is the main issue discussed here. The models can be used to interpret experimental data such as micrographs of crack surface or extent of crack damage, and stress/strain curves, and in general the models can be used as guidelines to design tougher composites.},

	abstract = {The effect of the orientation of metal wires on the opening of a crack in a brittle-matrix composite has been studied. The force arising from the plastic bending of a wire which is weakly bonded to the matrix and which crosses the matrix crack at an angle e to the crack face normal has been measured in model resin-wire composites and good agreement is found with a simple theory based on the calculation of the force needed to produce a plastic hinge in a cantilever beam. The force passes through a maximum at a small crack opening, of the order of one wire diameter, and decreases with further crack opening. The largest force is obtained for a value of 0 of approximately 45 degrees . For wires whose length approaches the critical length, the force and the total work of fracture arising from the bending of the wire are small compared to the values arising from the interfacial shear stress resisting pull-out; the contributions due to bending and interfacial shear stress are of comparable magnitudes
for wires which are approximately one-fifth of the critical length.},

The stress concentrations around a single fiber break are then employed in a Green's function model that predicts the evolution of multiple fiber damage under increasing applied load up to failure in moderate-sized composites. These studies explicitly demonstrate the local critical damage level that must be attained to drive global failure. Analytic models for scaling of the tensile strength to large sizes typical of test coupons and components are then employed. The general method is
applied to predict failure in an aluminium matrix reinforced with {Al2O3} fibers. Good agreement at small composite sizes is obtained, but the scaling of strength with size is weaker than is observed in experiments. Possible reasons for these deviations are discussed, focusing on the appropriate constitutive response for highly constrained metal yielding at small scales. The analytic models for strength also provide information on reliability versus size and are usable in stochastic finite element models.

	abstract = {A multiscale approach to composite failure, in which detailed information on small-scale micromechanics is incorporated approximately yet accurately into larger-scale models capable of simulating extensive damage evolution and ultimate failure, is applied to the deformation and failure of a Ti-matrix composite. The composite is reinforced with {SiC} fibers under conditions of matrix yielding and interfacial sliding via Coulomb friction. Specifically, a fully three-dimensional finite element model is employed to investigate the load transfer from broken to unbroken fibers as a function of applied stress and interface friction coefficient. With a von Mises matrix yield criterion, constraint effects permit the matrix to carry some of the transferred load near the fiber break, a feature not captured in previous composite models. The single-break results for stress concentrations are then used as the discrete Green's functions for load transfer in the full composite, and the predicted load transfer
around a seven-fiber-break cluster is shown in good agreement with finite element results. The Green's function model is then used to predict overall damage evolution and composite failure for an {IMI-834} {Ti/SCS-6} {SiC} system for various interface friction coefficients. The composite tensile strength is rather insensitive to the friction coefficient and, for values of mu comparable to those measured experimentally, the predicted tensile strength is in excellent agreement with the measured value. Analytic models for scaling of the tensile strength to very large sizes are then shown to agree well with strengths obtained from simulations. These results suggest that the hierarchical coupling approach used here may be useful for approaching a wide variety of damage and failure problems in fiber composites. (C) 2001 Acta Materialia Inc.

	abstract = {Abstract The techniques aimed at adhesion strength measurement between reinforcing fibers and polymer matrices (the pull-out and microbond tests) involve the measurement of the force, F max, required to pull out a fiber whose end is embedded in the matrix. Then, this maximum force value is used to calculate such interfacial parameters as the apparent bond strength, tauapp, and the local interfacial shear strength ({IFSS)}, taud. However, it has been demonstrated that the F max value is influenced by interfacial friction in already debonded regions, and, therefore, these parameters are not purely 'adhesional' but depend, in an intricate way, on interfacial adhesion and friction. In the last few years, several techniques for separate determination of adhesion and friction in micromechanical tests have been developed, but their experimental realization is rather complicated, because they require an accurate value of the external load at the moment of crack initiation. We have developed a new
technique which uses the relationship between the maximum force and the embedded length ('scale factor') to separately measure fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion and friction. Using the equation for the current crack length as a function of the applied load, based on a stress criterion of interfacial debonding, we modeled the pull-out and microbond experiments and obtained the maximum force value versus the embedded length. By varying taud and interfacial friction, tauf, to fit experimental plots, both interfacial parameters were estimated. The micromechanical tests were modeled for three types of specimen geometries (cylindrical specimens, spherical droplets, and matrix hemispheres in the pull-out test) with different levels of residual thermal stresses and interfacial friction. The effect of all these factors on the experimental results is discussed, and the importance of specimen geometry is demonstrated. One of the most interesting results is that the 'ultimate' {IFSS} (the limiting tauapp as the embedded
length tends to zero) is not always equal to the 'local' bond strength.},

The mediums from which the fiber was pulled included a control mortar mix without fibers, a mortar mix with 3, and 6 percent fibers by volume. The results indicate that: (1) The dense {DSP} matrix has significantly improved interfacial properties as compared to the conventional mortar matrix.

The properties of the probability distribution of bundle strength are next developed in detail, attention being confined in the present paper to the case where all threads have the same load-extension curve up to breaking point.

A Weibull distribution is assumed for fiber strength, and fibers adjacent to failed fibers are subjected to overloading according to a specified load sharing rule. As the composite grows in size, the bound approaches a Weibull distribution. The Weibull shape parameter for the composite is double that for the fiber, but the scale parameter is somewhat less. Features of the limiting Weibull bound are shown to be consistent with experimental observation, though numerically the bound is quite conservative.

L'analyse est basée sur un modèle probabiliste d'une série de bottes assurant la résistance d'un

On suppose que la résistance d'une fibre répond à une distribution de Weibull et que les fibres adjacentes à la fibre rompue sont sujettes à une surcharge correspondant à une règle spécifiée pour le partage des charges. Quand le composite augmente de dimension, la liaison atteint une distribution de Weibull.

A new relationship that links the crack opening to the panel deflection is proposed. Due to the stochastic nature of material properties, the random fibre distribution, and other uncertainties that are involved in concrete mix, this relationship is developed from the analysis of beams having the same thickness using the Monte Carlo simulation ({MCS)} technique. The softening diagrams obtained from direct tensile tests are used as the input for the calculation, in a deterministic way, of the mean load displacement response of round panels. A good agreement is found between the model predictions and the experimental results.},

The present paper gives an overview of the current knowledge regarding characterization and engineering of the interface. First, different mathematical models for the characterization of interface properties are reviewed, including strength as well as toughness based models, and basic interracial parameters are identified. Second, engineering tools are reviewed–primarily ways of increasing the fiber matrix bond by applying various strengthening techniques, including introduction of fiber deformations, densification of the porous fiber matrix interracial transition zone, and fiber surface modification using plasma treatment. The strengthening mechanisms are quantified through basic interracial parameters, and it is shown by reference to available experimental evidence that substantial improvements in the fiber matrix bond can be achieved, opening up the
field for further optimization of fiber reinforced cement based composites. Finally, gaps in the present knowledge are pointed out, identifying areas of future research in this area.},

Numerical representations of cohesive-zone models suffer from a certain mesh bias. For discrete representations this is caused by the initial mesh design, while for smeared representations it is rooted in the ill-posedness of the rate boundary value problem that arises upon the introduction of decohesion. A proper representation of the discrete character of cohesive-zone formulations which avoids any mesh bias can be obtained elegantly when exploiting the partition-of-unity property of finite element shape functions. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by some examples.},

Thus, in this study different innovative test methods are developed and used to identify the failure process of a strand as a result of the pull-out process and ascertain the contact faces between the individual filaments and the matrix. Additionally, based on these findings, numerical procedures are proposed to allow, for the first time, to establish a direct relationship between the load history of a pull-out test, to the failure process of an {AR-glass} strand, by means of a mathematical function; the so-called active filament versus displacement relation {NF(\&\#937;).} Together with the load versus displacement relationship P(\&\#937;) also derived during the pull-out
test, an analytical characterization and simulation of the bond between an {AR-glass} strand and a cement based matrix will be possible.},

Modelling aspects particular to the layered nature of the fibre metal laminates are discussed and implemented in the proposed framework. Practical application of the software is illustrated by computations on panels of {GLARE} (fibre metal laminate).},

The constitutive formulations are embedded in a thermodynamically consistent framework. The microplane formulation is based on a volumetric–deviatoric split ({V–D)}, which is motivated from a macroscopic viewpoint. The main advantage of this formulation is that the material behavior at a material point is characterized by constitutive laws formulated on the individual microplanes, allowing to describe anisotropic material behavior in a very natural and simple way. One particular advantage of the present version of a microplane formulation is also its close relation to macroscopic models which enables the interpretation and identification of the microplane constitutive laws in terms of well-known macroscopic constitutive laws. The appropriate choice of
the microplane loading functions is illustrated by a comparison of the microplane damage formulation with a macroscopic two-parameter damage model.},

Comparing the results to the response of a {FEM} model, some hints on the collapse mechanism of masonry show that the edge effects greatly affect the load carrying capacity of the brickwork. Besides, the plane section assumption is found to be acceptable up to the ultimate compressive strength, allowing relatively simple models to be used for arch-type structures.},

The seismic response of a set single storey systems, comprising of seismic resisting frames, and made of alternative materials (concrete or steel), is investigated under uni-directional earthquake loading excitations. Different layouts in plan, leading to either torsionally unrestrained or restrained systems, are considered. Sensitivity analyses are carried out in order to identify the influence of varying levels of torsional restraint on the residual deformations/

Pull-out behaviour subsequent to debonding was explained using this model in terms of an unyielded plug at the end of the wire.

This paper starts from the exact equations of elasticity for axisymmetric stress states in transversely isotropic materials and introduces the minimum assumptions required to derive the most commonly used shear-lag equations. These assumptions can now be checked to study the accuracy of shear-lag analysis on any problem. Some sample calculations were done for stress transfer from a matrix into a broken fiber. The shear-lag method did a reasonable job (within 20\%) of predicting average axial stress in the fiber and total strain energy in the specimen provided the shear-lag parameter most commonly used in the literature is replaced by a new one derived from the approximate elasticity analysis. The shear-lag method does a
much worse job of predicting shear stresses and energy release rates. Furthermore, the shear-lag method does not work for low fiber volume fractions.},

Thus, it is of great importance that the pullout test be interpreted in a way that yields the true material parameters. Two approaches to the fiber/matrix debonding problem can be made: (1) The stress approach where the criterion for growth of the debonded fiber/matrix interface is expressed in terms of the interfacial stress; and (2) the fracture mechanical approach where the criterion for interfacial debonding is expressed in terms of energy equilibrium. This paper investigates these two approaches by applying both to the same model, which includes frictional stresses on the debonded interface. The debonding load-versus-crack length relationships predicted by the two approaches are compared and differences in the parametric dependency are discussed. The results
predicted by the fracture mechanical approach are compared with available experimental results.},

Key features in each theory are identified including: types of failure models employed, whether linear or non-linear analysis was carried out, reliance on software and numerical methods, allowance for thermal stresses and identification of modes of failure. The results (initial and final failure envelopes and representative stress/strain curves) have been superimposed to show similarities and differences between the predictions of the various theories. In addition, bar charts were constructed to demonstrate the levels of agreement between the predicted initial and final failure stresses and strains. Sources of discrepancies between the

	abstract = {This paper reviews recent work and presents new results on statistical aspects of the failure of composites consisting of brittle fibers aligned in a brittle matrix. The failure process involves quasi-periodic matrix cracking in planes perpendicular to the fiber, frictional sliding of the fibers in fiber break zones, and fiber bridging of cracks in a load-sharing framework that may vary from global to fairly local. First, we review the overall statistical features of the failure process, and identify certain issues in terms of critical geometric, statistical and mechanical parameters. This leads to two interesting cases, one where the spacing of matrix cracks is small relative to the length scale of load transfer in the fibers, and one where it is larger. Next we consider 'characteristic' bundles in the composite which capture essential features of the statistics of the failure process, and develop their distributions for strength in terms of certain characteristic stress and length scales. We
then model the composite as a chain arrangement of such bundles both longitudinally and laterally, as the scale of load transfer among fibers in a bundle may be smaller than the full composite cross-section. This scale, though not precisely quantified, depends on such things as the stiffness of the matrix relative to the fibers, the volume fraction of the matrix and the spacing of periodic cracks. We then consider the strength distribution for the composite on the basis of the failure of the weakest characteristic bundle. We also consider issues related to fiber pull-out and the work of fracture as well as the possibility of severe strain localization especially within the bundle triggering overall failure. Substantial reductions in strength are predicted for smaller bundle sizes, but composite reliability is typically very high and the size effect very mild. Finally, we mention limited comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations and experimental results.},

Structural functions include mechanical properties like strength, stiffness, fracture toughness, and damping, while non-structural functions include electrical and/or thermal conductivity, sensing and actuation, energy harvesting/storage, self-healing capability, electromagnetic interference ({EMI)} shielding, recyclability and biodegradability. Many of these recent developments are associated with polymeric composite materials and corresponding advances in nanomaterials and nanostructures, as are many of
the articles reviewed. The article concludes with a discussion of recent applications of multifunctional materials and structures, such as morphing aircraft wings, structurally integrated electronic components, biomedical nanoparticles for dispensing drugs and diagnostics, and optically transparent impact absorbing structures.

	volume = {46},
	abstract = {A new simple model for predicting the uniaxial stress-strain behavior of a unidirectional ceramic matrix composite, including stochastic matrix crack evolution, stochastic fiber damage and ultimate failure, is presented. The model demonstrates an important transition in composite behavior. Brittle (low failure strain) behavior occurs when the matrix cracking stresses are sufficiently high: the composite fails during the matrix cracking regime of deformation and at a strain that is controlled by the matrix flaw population and elastic properties. Tough (high failure strain) behavior occurs when the matrix cracking stresses are lower; matrix cracking is completed prior to failure and the failure strain of the composite is controlled by the fibers. In both cases, the failure strength is fiber-controlled. The model is applied to study {SiC/SiC} 500-fiber minicomposite deformation, using data recently obtained by Lissart and Lamon on two material types, B and C. Parameters for the matrix flaw
population are used to fit the experimental stress-strain data but the failure is controlled by the measured fiber strength statistics. Excellent agreement is found for the C materials, which are in the transition regime between the brittle and tough limits and variations in fiber strength are postulated to be responsible for the wide range of behaviors found in the B materials. The fitted matrix flaw parameters are then used to predict the fiber matrix interfacial sliding resistance and the values obtained are in excellent agreement with independent values determined from both unload reload hysteresis loops and fiber pullout lengths. The new model provides a useful tool for understanding the interplay matrix and fiber flaw distributions and the overall dependence of stress-strain behavior on all the underlying constituent material properties.},

In order to reveal its complexity some experimental investigations are summarized. It is recognizable that the bond between concrete and filaments is subject to some deficiencies. Therefore, mechanical models are required to describe the early failure of single filaments as well as the bond and friction behavior of filaments and concrete. The mechanical models are solved numerically within a finite element framework. Exemplary calculations for an ideal yarn and important cases of deficiencies show typical properties of the load carrying and the bond behavior.},

	abstract = {A Green's function method ({GFM)} for simulating fiber damage evolution and tensile strength in fiber-reinforced composites is compared in detail to the predictions of the standard shear-lag model ({SLM)} widely used in the literature. The {GFM} extracts the in-plane stress concentration factors describing how a broken fiber redistributes in-plane load to surrounding unbroken fibers from more-detailed micromechanical models, such as finite-element models, and uses this limited information to then calculate the propagation of fiber damage up to composite failure. The {GFM} only approximately includes the three-dimensional nature of the stress transfer and uses an approximate superposition method, but reduces the computational problem significantly. Here, elastic and elastic/plastic {3D} {SLM} are used to provide the stress-transfer input to the {GFM}, and then predictions for composite behavior from the {GFM} are compared directly to those from the {SLM.} For exactly the same starting
configuration of stochastic fibers, the {GFM} predicts (i) evolution of the fiber damage and the formation of critical clusters that are nearly identical to, (ii) composite tensile strengths within 2\% of, (iii) a Weibull modulus for the composite strength essentially equal to, that of the {SLM}, all while requiring over an order of magnitude less computational time for modest-size composites. The approximations made in the {GFM} are found to have little effect on composite properties. These results support the use of the {GFM} approach with stress transfer input from accurate detailed finite element studies rather than from approximate {SLM.} Furthermore, the {GFM} is well-suited for tackling a wide range of problems that cannot easily be studied using the {SLM;} e.g. bending deformation and failure, matrix crack propagation, fatigue crack growth, and other situations in which the fiber stress distribution is nonuniform even in the absence of any fiber damage.

	abstract = {A mechanical multi-scale model describing the relationship between the crack-opening and composite bridging stress in brittle matrix composites with heterogeneous reinforcement is introduced. Unlike currently utilized models, it is able to reflect the heterogeneity of fibrous reinforcement. Mechanical, geometrical and bond properties of individual fibers (e.g. fiber surface roughness, radius, strength) are defined as random variables. The functional dependency between these random variables and the fiber stress within the composite cross-section is introduced using local equilibrium equations. The response of the composite to an applied uniaxial tensile load is evaluated by averaging the fiber stress contributions in a crack bridge. In particular, the model describes the behavior of a single crack bridge in a composite assuming the matrix to be rigid. The fiber bridging action is represented using the shear-lag model. Upon fiber rupture the global load sharing for stress redistribution is
considered. With these assumptions the rules for asymptotic Daniels’ fiber-bundle models can be applied for the evaluation of macroscopic crack bridge behavior. We use the model to illuminate the effect of selected sources of heterogeneity (fiber breaking strain, fiber radius and bond strength) on the crack bridge response and to approximately predict the ultimate state of a multiply cracked composite. The model constitutes a basis for the multi-scale simulation of the strain-hardening response of brittle-matrix composites.},

	abstract = {Fiber-reinforced concrete ({FRC)} showing strain hardening after cracking is commonly defined as High Performance Fiber-Reinforced Cementitious Composite ({HPFRCC).} In the post-cracking stage, several cracks develop before complete failure, which occurs when tensile strains localize in one of the formed cracks. As is well known, multiple cracking and strain hardening can be achieved in cement-based specimens subjected to uniaxial tension by increasing the volume fraction of steel fibers with hooked ends, or by using plastic fibers with and without steel fibers, or by means of high bond steel fibers (e.g., twisted fibers or cords). To better understand why, in such situations, high mechanical performances are obtained, an analytical model is herein proposed. It is based on a cohesive interface analysis, which has been largely adopted to investigate the mechanical response of {FRC} or the snubbing effects produced by inclined fibers, but not the condition of multiple cracking and strain hardening
of {HPFRCC.} Through this approach, all the phenomena that affect the post-cracking response of {FRC} are evidenced, such as the nonlinear fracture mechanics of the matrix, the bond–slip behaviour between fibers and matrix, and the elastic response of both materials. The model, capable of predicting the average distance between cracks as measured in some experimental campaigns, leads to a new design criterion for {HPFRCC} and can eventually be used to enhance the performances of cement-based composites},

In this contribution, we propose a novel computational approach to describe failure processes in fibre reinforced concrete. A discrete treatment of fibres enables us to study the influence of various fibre distributions on the mechanical properties of the material. To ensure numerical efficiency, fibres are not explicitly discretized but they are modelled by applying discrete forces to a background mesh. The background mesh represents the matrix while the discrete forces represent the interaction between fibres and matrix. These forces are assumed to be equal to fibre pull-out forces. With this approach experimental data or micro mechanical models, including detailed information about the fibre–matrix interface, can be directly incorporated into the model.},

In these references a fundamental study of the bond stress-slip relationship between steel fibers and cement composites is presented and correlated with the pullout problem. The analysis consists of a primal problem, whereby a complete pullout load versus slip curve can be predicted from an assumed (or experimental) bond stress versus slip relationship, and, a dual problem, in which the bond stress versus slip relationship is obtained from an experimental pullout curve. The solution presented is most general. The main purpose of this comment is to show first
that the model developed by Li et al. is a subset of the general model 1and .second that, because of simplifying assumptions, it may be quite limited in scope.},

	abstract = {A practical framework for generating cross correlated random fields with a specified marginal distribution function, an autocorrelation function and cross correlation coefficients is presented in the paper. The approach relies on well-known series expansion methods for simulation of a Gaussian random field. The proposed method requires all cross correlated fields over the domain to share an identical autocorrelation function and the cross correlation structure between each pair of simulated fields to be simply defined by a cross correlation coefficient. Such relations result in specific properties of eigenvectors of covariance matrices of discretized field over the domain. These properties are used to decompose the eigenproblem, which must normally be solved in computing the series expansion, into two smaller eigenproblems. Such a decomposition represents a significant reduction of computational effort. Non-Gaussian components of a multivariate random field are proposed to be simulated via
memoryless transformation of underlying Gaussian random fields for which the Nataf model is employed to modify the correlation structure. In this method, the autocorrelation structure of each field is fulfilled exactly while the cross correlation is only approximated. The associated errors can be computed before performing simulations and it is shown that the errors happen only in the cross correlation between distant points and that they are negligibly small in practical situations. Some comments on available techniques for simulation of underlying random variables in connection with the accuracy of basic fields’ statistics at a given sample size are made. For this purpose a simple error assessment procedure is presented. Simulated random fields can be used both for representation of spatially correlated properties of structure or random load in the stochastic finite element method ({SFEM).} An example of this application is related to size effect studies in the nonlinear fracture mechanics of concrete, and
is used to illustrate the method.},

Fiber strength is governed by flaws that follow {Weibull/Poisson} statistics. The model assumes that, under increasing applied strain on the {SFC}, fiber breaks occur randomly along the fiber from which matrix yield zones grow. At a critical strain, debond zones also initiate and grow from these breaks, resulting in fiber sliding with friction at the interface. This results in a two-step, shear traction profile producing bi-linear fiber stress recovery from breaks up to a plateau stress. These zones of yielding and debonding form growing exclusion zones around breaks within which further fiber fractures cannot occur. Eventually such zones cover the fiber, a condition called saturation. We model the fragmentation process by using a newly developed statistical theory that embodies the
exclusion zone concept. Key parameters are the debond stress and the friction-yield stress ratio. These parameters are varied to determine the effects of debonding on the average fiber fragmentation length versus applied strain. We also obtain accurate estimates of the mean and variance in the stress along a fiber versus applied strain, and mention complications involved in obtaining the true values. These quantities are used to study the strength distribution and toughness of a long multi-fiber composite undergoing global load-sharing among fibers. Finally, we suggest how to estimate the model parameters from {SFC} test data.},

These equations are derived with no a priori assumptions regarding the distribution for fiber strength except that the distribution of fiber flaws along the length follows a compound Poisson process in terms of flaw strength. Furthermore, the interface model and the fiber stress profile in the exclusion zone around a fiber break can be arbitrary as long as the exclusion zone is well defined. Explicit and exact closed-form solutions of the governing equations are obtained under these general conditions including random initial breaks before load is applied, which have exponentially distributed spacings of a given normalized rate a along the fiber. We demonstrate this method by finding the exact closed-form solution for a bilinear stress interface model proposed earlier. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

For the analysis of bundles with infinite number of fibers we use a con- tinuous analytical model with refined kinematic hypothesis. In parallel, we apply a more general discrete numerical bun- dle model covering the cases of finite number of fibers and spatial variations of material properties. The considered distributions of material properties include variations of parameters (local stiffness and strength) both from filament to filament and over the length of each filament. In the present paper, we study the influence of variations in filament \&\#711; ´ properties across the bundle. In the companion paper (Vo\v{r}echovsk\'{y}, M., Chudoba, R., 2006. Stochastic modeling of multi-filament yarns. {II.} Random properties over the length and size effect. International Journal of Solids and Struc- tures), the variations of material
properties over the length are considered. Both papers provide the basis for correct interpretation of the data obtained from the tensile test on multi-filament yarn with varied specimen length.

	abstract = {A micromechanics damage model is presented which examines the effect of fibre-matrix debonding and thermal residual stress on the transverse damage behaviour of a unidirectional carbon fibre reinforced epoxy composite. It is found that for a weak fibre-matrix interface, the presence of thermal residual stress can induce damage prior to mechanical loading. However, for a strong fibre-matrix interface the presence of thermal residual stress is effective in suppressing fibre-matrix debonding and improving overall transverse strength by approximately 7\%. The micromechanical model is subjected to a multiple loading cycle (i.e. tension-compression-tension), where it is shown to provide novel insight into the microscopic damage accumulation that forms prior to ultimate failure, clearly highlighting the different roles that fibre-matrix debonding and matrix plasticity play in forming the macroscopic response of the composite. Such information is vital to the development of accurate continuum damage
models, which often smear these effects using non-physical material parameters. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The chain-of-bundles model for the strength of unidirectional fibrous materials is extended to cover 3D situations wherein the parallel filaments are arranged laterally in a hexagonal array. Within each bundle, the strengths of the fibres vary statistically and share load according to a local load-sharing rule, a rule which describes how the loads of failed fibres are redistributed on to nearby surviving fibres. We consider two idealized versions of this rule, one geometrically motivated and the other more mechanically motivated. We extend earlier asymptotic techniques for the 2D planar problem to the present 3D case, and obtain various approximations for the probability distribution for material strength. The Weibull distribution again emerges as central to the results, but the calculation of its shape and scale parameters is greatly complicated by the large number of new failure configurations that may arise in the hexagonal array of fibres. Earlier 2D results connecting the Weibull shape parameter to the critical failure sequence size do not in general hold in 3D settings. The general character of the results, however, is the same as in the 2D setting, with 3D materials being stronger because of the reduced severity of the fibre overloads in the hexagonal array. Also, the two local load-sharing rules though quite different in character yield surprisingly similar numerical results.},

Monte-Carlo simulations are performed using a modified version of the Mori-Tanaka Mean-Field theory under different combinations of parameter randomness. The results indicate that the randomness in interface imperfection, fibre orientation and length, and fibre stiffness have a significant influence on the variability of the composite properties.

These experiments show that failure in tension occurs in several stages (similar to cer- tain other brittle fiber composites): multiple matrix cracking, followed by fiber fracture and pullout. I n flexural loading the failure process is more complex. Consequently, the flexural test cannot be used for measurement of tensile strength (although it can be used for measurement of the stress for matrix crack- ing). The application of conventional fracture mechanics to describe tensile failure is discussed. The in situ observations provide direct indication of the importance of frictional bond- ing between the matrix and fibers. Some novel methods for measuring the frictional forces and residual stresses are in- vestigated, and the influence of surface damage on strength is assessed.},

The concept of a relationship between the bond shear stress and the local slip at the interface between the reinforcement and the matrix for fiber-reinforced, cement-based composites is relatively new. Moreover, the difficulties involved in conducting strain measurements on short discontinuous fibers have made it impossible so far to develop experimental bond shear stress versus slip curves for fiber-reinforced concrete. This paper involves a fundamental study of the bond-stress-slip relationship between steel fibers and concrete. The analysis consists of a primal problem, whereby a complete pullout curve is predicted from an assumed bond-slip relationship, and a dual problem in which the bond-slip relationship is obtained from an experimental pullout curve. The frictional behavior of the interface is also related to and explained by the shrink-fit and fiber-matrix misfit theory.
The theory derived in this paper is validated in a second paper using experimental pullout load versus slip curves.},

The relevant dimension may be the diameter of a bundle or of separate fibres or the thickness of the transverse ply in a 0 deg / 90 deg laminate. Our previous theory of multiple cracking and constrained failure is reviewed and applied to simple laminates and laminated hybrids. We also demonstrate that it can be applied to preventing cracking due to thermal strain. It is pointed out that, in 0 deg/90 deg/0 deg laminates, longitudinal splitting of the 0 deg plies may occur owing to the constraint imposed by the 90 deg plies, whether these have cracked or not. Simple rules are given to account for the longitudinal ultimate strength and ultimate fracture strain of intermingled glass and carbon hybrids in epoxy resin. In this system, stress
concentrations due to failure of the low elongation component do not appear to be very important.},

In this paper, strength-based and fracture-based fiber debonding criteria are reviewed. To determine whether interracial debonding is governed by the bond strength or critical energy release rate of the fiber-matrix interphase, fiber pull-out experiments were conducted using steel and brass wires of various diameters. The bond properties, including effective bond strength and frictionalstress, were interpreted through a theoretical model of fiber pull-out. It was found that, for the material systems tested, interracial debonding is dominated by frictional stress which is independent of the fiber diameters. Therefore, the debond mode of these material systems is categorized as strength-based. In general, the debond mode is a material characteristic and is dependent on the specific fiber and matrix types. In order to precisely predict the mechanical
response of a fiber reinforced cementitious composite, it is necessary to determine the debond mode for a particular material system following the methodology proposed in this paper.},

The bundles are assumed to be composed of several sub-bundles wherein the random variables associated with the loading and failure of any two fibers in the same sub-bundle are allowed to be probabilistically dependent. Derivation of the basic asymptotic results involves an adaptation of earlier analysis by Phoenix and Taylor. Examples involve a modification of Daniels' earlier bundle model to include both random fiber and random sub-bundle slack. Second order approximate results are developed which indicate that random slack results in a loss in asymptotic bundle strength mean and a change in asymptotic variance both of which are approximately proportional to the random fiber slack variance. Coleman's earlier model is modified to demonstrate the effects of such slack on the strength distribution of bundles of brittle linearly elastic fibers. The results have implications in forecasting
the tensile strength behavior of fibrous cables and unidirectional composite materials.},

	abstract = {For over two decades the single-filament-composite ({SFC)} test has been an important tool in the study of the failure of fibrous composites. The {SFC} test itself involves a single brittle fiber embedded along the center-line of a matrix specimen of both large cross-sectional area and strain to failure. With increasing strain, the fiber fractures progressively, breaking into an increasing number of shorter and shorter fragments. Surrounding each break a shielded or exclusion zone develops within which no further breaks typically occur. At some strain level ‘saturation’ occurs abruptly as the shielded zones finally occupy the whole fiber, thus leaving a final distribution of fiber fragments end-to-end. Two uses for the {SFC} test have emerged: one has been to estimate the interfacial shear stress, τ, in the exclusion zone, sometimes called the interfacial shear strength and usually idealized as a constant over this zone. The other has been to estimate the fiber strength distribution and in
particular the Weibull shape and scale parameters, ρ and σl, for fiber strength appropriate to some characteristic ‘gage’ length, l, such as the mean fragmentation length. In the past, theoretical bases for these estimates have handled the statistics of shielding in ways that have led to quite large biases. The purpose of the present paper is to use some recent theoretical advances to develop more sophisticated estimation procedures for τ and the Weibull fiber strength parameters ‘ in situ’, and thus to eliminate various errors in previous methods. Straightforward computer programs (written in release 3 of Maple), which calculate the various quantities in the paper, will be provided by the first or second author on request.},

The theory is based on the similarity between multiple matrix cracking and fiber fragmentation in a single-fibercomposite, a problem recently addressed by the present author. Assuming a critical strain criterion for matrix cracking, the number of matrix cracks vs applied stress and the distribution of crack spacings at saturation are shown to depend on the statistical distribution of initial flaws in the material and the material constituent properties, particularly the fiber/matrix interracial sliding resistance z. Hence, using the theory to fit experimental data on multiple cracking leads to a deduction for the value of z. Application of the theory to recent data on Nicalon {fiber/CAS} glass composites yields estimates of z = 19 and 22 {MPa} on two different samples. These values of z are close to some estimates obtained by other approximate means but in disagreement with other estimates, and the origin of the discrepancy between various values of z is as yet unresolved.},

A 3-D lattice Green's function model is used to calculate the stress field, damage evolution, and Failure in composites under {''Local} Load Sharing'' ({LLS)} conditions in which the stress from broken fibers is transferred predominantly to the nearby unbroken fibers. Failure by local accumulation of a critical amount of damage, and the associated decrease in ultimate strength with increasing composite size, is explicitly demonstrated. Weakest-link statistics are then employed to investigate size effects and reliability. An intrinsic ''link'' in {LLS} is found which has the same Gaussian distribution function for strength as a bundle in Global Load Sharing ({GLS)} (no local stress concentrations) of the same size. The size of the link is found to be comparable to the critical cluster of fiber damage observed in the simulations. Then, using known results for the
{GLS} probability distribution function, analytic asymptotic results for the strength and reliability of large composites in {LLS} are derived. The strength distribution shows excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation results for both the median strength and high reliability tail of the distribution. The implications of these results on the expected strength and reliability of moderate-size composites components is discussed, with applications to a Ti-{MMC} and a {SiC/SiC} {CMC.} Finally, the application of these results to modeling of composite failure by the Finite Element Method is presented.

To find a bridge between the microscopic and macroscopic mechanical properties, this work investigates the nanoscopic nature of surface/interphases in terms of topography, fractography, adhesion and stiffness. Here, we show that variations in both adhesive and attractive forces on oxidized high modulus ({HM)} and intermediate modulus ({IM)} carbon fiber surfaces appear to result from the coating layer. The coating layer is critical for adhesive interaction with two different epoxy resins. The {HM} fiber has the apparently higher roughness but lower surface area than the {IM} fiber on the scanning scale of 200 nm. The surface roughness on a few tens of nanometer scale has no significant contribution to interphase adhesion from ‘mechanical interlocking’. In contrast, the true contact area on the nanometer scale plays a dominant role in interfacial adhesion. Using force volume nanoindentation, the
stiffness of the resin region near the finished fiber surface was found to not depend on the distance from the fiber surface. Our observations suggest an energy-geometry link between critical interphase energy release rate by micromechanical testing and detailed fracture surface features.},

Fiber debonding, which results in the formation of bridging ligaments at the wake of cracks, is the major mechanism accounting for performance improvement. A strength-based two-way debonding theory, which accounts for fiber debonding at both the pulled and embedded ends, has recently been developed. In this paper, two-way debonding based on a fracture criterion is considered. With the fracture-based debonding theory, expressions for fiber stress and displacement, and thus the general debonding features, are found to be similar to those given by the strength-based theory. However, interpreting the same interfacial measurement (such as a pullout test record) with the strength and fracture approaches will lead to predictions of different debonding behavior in composites with practical volume fractions. To determine whether debonding is governed by strength or fracture,
interfacial properties should be measured from a number of specimens with different fiber sizes or fiber volume fractions.},

	abstract = {The research of a new composite material is a complex task with the goal of assessing the mechanical, chemical, economical and technological aspects of the material. The diversity and complexity of the involved research fields calls for a collaboration of specialists coming from various research disciplines. The goal-oriented modification of existing material components in order to combine them into a new composite material requires detailed research of the underlying material components and mutual interaction effects. Experiments and numerical models help in understanding and improving the performance of the composite material. In order to promote the economic success of the developed material, production technology, processibility, durability and fields of applications have to be researched. In fact, material research is characterized by a parallel and spatial distributed collaboration of specialists. the coordination of the research process requires effective software support for information
sharing in form of data exchange, data analysis and archival storage. Flexible structuring of the data gathered from several sources is a crucial premise for a transparent accumulation of knowledge and, thus, for an efficient research in a long run. At the collaborative research center {`Textile} reinforced concrete: the basis for the development of a new material technology` installed in 1998 at Aachen University these requirements led to the development of a technical information system ({TIS).} In the design and implementation static aspects of the data structure stood in the foreground: A product model reflecting the main data of material research was defined and realized as a web-based database system. The system allows participating research groups to store and exchange data. Predefined queries provide overviews for experiments, material components and material flow, publications and appointed meetings. the course of recent years additional functionality has been requested and introduced. Evaluation
processes like sensitivity analysis or the calibration of numerical models have been implemented. Further processes like parameter studies or model validation will be realized in the future. The growing number and complexity of processes requires the definition of a process model and the preparation of a common infrastructure. This chapter reviews the state of the art of process modeling and languages and develops a strategy for modeling and implementing processes in material research. remainder of this work is structured as follows: Chapter 2 describes central elements of the object-oriented product model with the help of {UML} class diagrams. The third chapter gives an informal description of the Technical Information System. Chapter 4 provides a short overview about process research and presents some languages which have been used for the formulation of processes. Chapter 5 describes the concepts and realization proposed in this work. Chapters 6 and 7 show two examples which have been implemented as a
prototype realization. This work has been written with the goal of making it readable and understandable for both computer scientists and specialists from other research areas. This regards the modeling and implementation strategy as well as the text itself.},

This procedure is based on a newly developed statistical theory for single-fiber composite tests. This procedure is used to evaluate the interfacial shear strength of {HTA} carbon fiber in an epoxy matrix with two different sizings. Pt is shown that if the experiment data are presented in the form of the normalized variables, (l) over bar(f)/delta(c), and sigma/sigma(c), the two sets of data corresponding to the two different sizings can be collapsed into a single curve which can be obtained theoretically. Excellent agreement between experiments and theory is found. An argument is presented for the use of the interfacial sheer strength as an engineering parameter to characterize interface adhesion. We also investigate the effect of residual stresses due to thermal-expansion coefficient mismatch between the fiber and the matrix on the interpretation of single-fiber composite
tests. We found that the: experimentally determined Weibull parameters are very sensitive to the effect of these residual stresses and must be taken into consideration when interpreting single-filament composite tests. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	url = {http://www-personal.umich.edu/ jbarber/JACS92.pdf},
	abstract = {Conventional shear-lag analyses of matrix cracking and debonding in uniaxial composites loaded in tension predict that the matrix stress varies only very slowly with position except near existing cracks. It therefore follows that the location of subsequent cracks is very sensitive to minor local variations in matrix strength, leading to significant statistical variation in crack spacing. This question is investigated using a discrete random process model of a composite and by direct experimental measurements of crack spacing. In the limit of a completely homogeneous composite, it is shown that the crack spacing distribution tends to an inverse square distribution between the theoretical maximum spacing and half that value. The random process model recovers this behavior in the limit and exhibits an approximately Weibull distribution of crack spacings when the matrix strength has significant variance. The theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results obtained for a unidirectional ceramic-matrix composite (SiC fibers in a calcium aluminosilicate matrix). The experimental results exhibit features similar to those predicted by the model and are compatible with a matrix strength whose standard deviation is of the order of 40% of the mean strength. An important point is that, with this magnitude of strength variation, the material exhibits a significant size effect and it is essential to take this into account in estimating the mean crack spacing from the corresponding mean matrix properties.},

	abstract = {The possibility of decreasing ultimate tensile strength associated with increasing fiber/matrix interfacial sliding is investigated in ceramic-matrix composites. An axisymmetric finite-element model is used to calculate axial fiber stresses versus radial position within the slipping region around an impinging matrix crack as a function of applied stress and interfacial sliding stress τ. The stress fields, showing an enhancement at the fiber surface, are then utilized as an effective applied field acting on annular flaws at the fiber surface, and a mode I stress intensity is calculated as a function of applied stress, interface τ and flaw size. The total probability of failure due to a pre-existing spectrum of flaws in the fibers is then determined and utilized within the Global Load Sharing model to predict fiber damage evolution and ultimate failure. For small fiber Weibull moduli (m≈4), the local stress enhancements are insufficient to preferentially drive failure near the matrix crack. Hence,
the composite tensile strength is weakly affected and follows the shear-lag model predictions, which show a monotonically increasing strength with increasing τ. For larger Weibull moduli (m≈20), the composite is found to weaken beyond about τ=50 {MPa} and exhibit reduced fiber pullout, both leading to an apparent embrittlement and showing substantial differences compared with the shear-lag model.

	abstract = {For meeting the requirements of lightweight and improved mechanical properties, composites could be tailor-made for specific applications if the adhesion strength which plays a key role for improved properties can be predicted. The relationship between wettability and adhesion strength has been discussed. The microstructure of interphases and adhesion strength can be significantly altered by different surface modifications of the reinforcing fibers, since the specific properties of the interphase result from nucleation, thermal and/or intrinsic stresses, sizing used, interdiffusion, and roughness. The experimental results could not confirm a simple and direct correlation between wettability and adhesion strength for different model systems. The main objective of the work was to identify the interphases for different fiber/polymer matrix systems. By using phase imaging and nanoindentation tests based on atomic force microscopy ({AFM)}, a comparative study of the local mechanical property
variation in the interphase of glass fiber reinforced epoxy resin ({EP)} and glass fiber reinforced polypropylene matrix ({PP)} composites was conducted. As model sizings for {PP} composites, \&\#947;-aminopropyltriethoxysilane ({APS)} and either polyurethane ({PU)} or polypropylene ({PP)} film former on glass fibers were investigated. The {EP-matrix} was combined with either unsized glass fibers or glass fibers treated with {APS/PU} sizing. It was found that phase imaging {AFM} was a highly useful tool for probing the interphase with much detailed information. Nanoindentation with sufficiently small indentation force was found to be sufficient for measuring actual interphase properties within a 100-nm region close to the fiber surface. Subsequently, it also indicated a different gradient in the modulus across the interphase region due to different sizings. The possibilities of controlling bond strength between fiber surface and polymer matrix are discussed in terms of elastic moduli of the interphases
compared with surface stiffness of sized glass fibers, micromechanical results, and the mechanical properties of real composites.},

	abstract = {The machanical behavior of brittle matrix composites is strongly affected by the bridging of cracks by fibers. In random fiber composites, fibers can lie at an angle to the crack plane. Under such conditions, the bridging stress for a certain crack opening is governed by various micromechanisms including fiber debonding, fiber bending and rupture as well as matrix spalling. While fiber debonding has been widely investigated, the coupled fiber bending/matrix spalling mechanism has received little attention. In this paper, the fiber bending/matrix spalling mechanism is analyzed by treating the fiber as a beam bent on an elastic foundation with variable stiffness and the possibility of spalling. The foundation stiffness and spalling criterion are derived from a finite element analysis. The bridging stress due to bending alone as well as the total bridging stress are then obtained for the case with brittle fibers. Through this analysis, the effect of various microstructural parameters (such as fiber
and matrix moduli, matrix spalling strain and fiber/matrix interfacial friction) on the behavior of random fiber composites can be studied. Prediction of maximum bridging stress for inclined fibers based on the present model is shown to be in good agreement with experimental results.},

	abstract = {The stress transfer from broken to unbroken fibers in fiber-reinforced polymer-matrix ({PMC)} and aluminum-matrix ({AMC)} composites is studied using a detailed {3D} finite element model ({FEM)} and using the standard shear-lag model ({SLM).} The stress transfer predicted by the {SLM} is in good agreement with the {FEM} results for the {PMC} at high fiber volume fractions but not at low volume fractions. For the {AMC} with an elastic/plastic matrix, the {FEM} results depend on whether the fiber is broken initially (pre-break) or after loading (post-break), while the {SLM} is independent of the fiber break load. Compared to the pre-break {FEM}, the stress transfer in the {SLM} is too low at high volume fractions and fairly accurate at low volume fractions while the reverse trend obtains when the {SLM} is compared to the post-break {FEM.} These results suggest that the {SLM} is generally accurate for high fiber/matrix stiffness ratios and high fiber volume fractions, and/or when global matrix
yielding proceeds fiber breaking such that the tangent stiffness of the matrix is small. At low volume fractions, matrix load carrying capacity accounts for much of the discrepancy between the {SLM} and the {FEM}, which can be rectified by more sophisticated {SLMs.} A simple elastic model demonstrates that neglect of the finite fiber dimensions and fiber shear deformation in the {SLM} can also affect the stress transfer. It is concluded that although the standard {SLM} cannot generally be used for simulations of composite deformation and failure, it is reasonably accurate for an important range of composite constituent material properties.},

	abstract = {A probabilistic approach is used in this paper to describe matrix multiple cracking in textile reinforced concrete specimens under tension as function of the applied load. The presented model is based on the well-known Aveston-Cooper-Kelly theory ({ACK-theory)}, except for one hypothesis: it is not assumed that all matrix multiple cracking occurs at one fixed stress level. A two-parameter Weibull model represents the failure properties of the matrix. The presented ‘stochastic cracking’ theory is verified on two series of specimens: slightly reinforced specimens and heavily reinforced specimens. As will be shown, the ‘stochastic cracking theory’ leads to good prediction of the nonlinear stress-strain behaviour in tension. Nonetheless, the properties measured on the separate materials do not always represent the material properties of this same material when combined with the other},

The heterogeneity of both the matrix and the reinforcement occurs at similar length scales of the material structure and demands for an improved accuracy to capture the relevant damage mechanisms. For this purpose, the {eXtended} Finite Element Method (X-{FEM)} is utilized by augmenting the finite elements with special functions reflecting the discontinuities both in the matrix displacement and in the slip between the matrix and the reinforcement. The approach is presented for the {1D} example of a tension bar with two interacting cracks.

The rate-type constitutive law incorporates linear visco-elasticity and continuum plasticity. The former accounts for the bulk creep via a Maxwell chain, while the latter describes crack initiation and propagation via a softening, anisotropic Rankine yield criterion. The rate dependence of bond ruptures leading to fracture is accounted for by considering the viscosity of the cracking process. This contribution to the cracking resistance also regularises the localisation process. It is demonstrated how other important phenomena in cementitious materials, such as stress-dependent hygral and thermal shrinkage, can be incorporated into the computational framework.},

In particular, we analyzed the influence of varying cross-sectional area, filament length and delayed activation. Inclusion of these effects has lead to a better interpretation of the experimental data, especially with respect to the gradual stiffness activation, post-peak behavior and some form of size effect. In the present paper, the length- related distributions of local stiffness and strength are included in terms of theoretical considerations and by applying the Monte Carlo type simulation of random fields. Such an approach allows us (1) to demonstrate the strong need for including length scale to
random fluctuation of strength along the filaments and (2) to combine several sources of randomness in a single analysis so that their significance can be evaluated from the tensile test response.},

	abstract = {The behaviour of stainless steel, work-hardened nickel and annealed nickel wires bridging a crack in a brittle-matrix has been studied as a function of the length and orientation of the wire. The pull-out stress for stainless steel wire in epoxy resin increases less than linearly with wire length, following the behaviour predicted by Takaku and Arridge [6]. Wires inclined at 20 and 40 to the tensile axis gave pull-out stresses some 30\% higher than wires parallel to the tensile axis, this increase being attributed mainly to enhanced friction on the bent wire near its point of exit from the matrix. Work-hardened nickel wires fractured when their length exceeded a critical value, and the critical length was significantly shorter for inclined wires than for wires parallel to the tensile axis. In contrast, annealed nickel wires, no matter how long, did not fracture but pulled out at a limiting stress which was slightly higher for inclined wires than for wires parallel to the tensile axis. The
results show that, in some cases, there does not exist a critical length above which an embedded wire will fracture rather than pull out of the matrix.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Delamination in composite structures is best modelled at a mesoscopic level. In this approach, the plies are modelled as continua, which can either be assumed to behave linearly elastically or to degrade according to a damage law. Delamination in the interfaces between them is modelled using a discrete relation between interface tractions and relative displacements. Key in this type of modelling is the presence of a work of separation or fracture energy, which governs the growth of the delamination. This cohesive-surface approach has traditionally been implemented numerically using special interface elements which connect the continuum elements that are used to model the plies. Exploiting the partition-of-unity property of finite element shape functions to model the interface separation process offers some advantages, since interfaces can be inserted at the onset of delamination and not a priori, as in the conventional approach. As a consequence, elastic compliance of the interface
prior to onset of delamination, spurious traction oscillations ahead of the delamination front and spurious wave reflections because of the presence of a high stiffness value are avoided. Moreover, unlike the conventional approach, unstructured meshes can be employed.},

	abstract = {The tensile failure of fiber-reinforced composites in {2D} (1-ply) and thin multi-ply samples has been studied numerically in order to assess the role of dimensionality on the absolute magnitude, reliability, and size scaling of composite strength. Single-ply tapes, often used in model calculations because of the simplifications attending the reduced dimensionality, and 2-ply tapes are shown to have (i) lower strengths than 4-ply specimens, with the latter approaching ‘bulk’ response, and (ii) broader failure probability distributions than 4-ply samples. These two effects together indicate that using a 1-ply or 2-ply geometry to investigate composite strength size effects and reliability, or to compare against real composites, is not quantitatively accurate. Calculations are also performed on the same systems but with fiber ‘pull-out’ loads, i.e. the residual load carrying capability of broken fibers in the composite, essentially eliminated. Such a model approximates the ‘chain of bundles’
models widely developed for prediction of composite failure. In the absence of fiber pull-out, the composite strength is much lower and again more broadly distributed. Overall, the present results suggest that simplified analytic and computational models based on a {2D} tape geometry and/or neglecting fiber ‘pull-out’ must be viewed with caution in applications to real composite systems.},

	volume = {120},
	abstract = {The paper analyzes the size effect, which is an inevitable consequence of softening in the relation of interface shear stress and slip displacement between a fiber or reinforcing bar and the surrounding matrix. The problem is simplified as one-dimensional. Closed-form solutions of pull-pull and push-pull failures are obtained for a linear softening stress-slip law with residual strength, and for an exponential law without residual strength. The postpeak softening is shown to lead to localization of slip and interface shear fracture with a process zone of finite length. This zone propagates along the interface during the loading process, causing the distribution of interface shear stress to become strongly nonuniform. The larger the bar or fiber size, the stronger the {nonuniformity.The} size effect in geometrically similar pullout tests of different sizes is found to represent a smooth transition between two simple asymptotic cases:(1) The case of no size effect, which occurs for very small
sizes and is characteristic of plastic failure; and (2) the case of a size effect of the same type as in linear elastic fracture mechanics, in which the difference of the pullout stress from its residual value is proportional to the inverse square root of the fiber or bar diameter. An analytical expression for the transitional size effect is obtained. This expression is found to approximately agree with the generalized form of the size effect law proposed by Ba ant. The shape of the size effect curve is shown to be related to the shape of the softening stress-slip law for the interface. Finally, it is shown how measurements of the size effect can be used for identifying the interface properties, and a numerical example is given.},

	abstract = {Experimental investigations with textile reinforced concrete ({TRC)} samples show very complex damage and failure mechanisms on different scales. Therefore, descriptions on the micro-, meso- and macro-scale are introduced as parts of a hierarchical material model of textile reinforced concrete. This paper gives a survey on micro-mechanical models, like the adhesive cross linkage model or the plug model. The results from the micro-scale are used in mesoscopic models to simulate engineered textile structures embedded in the cementitious matrix. Therefore, cell methods are used. By means of homogenisation techniques the heterogeneous composite {TRC} is treated homogeneously on the macro-scale. Based on this hierarchical material and the bridging between the different scales, multi-scale finite element methods ({MS-FEM)} of a sequential and integrated type are discussed.},

	abstract = {The interphase between reinforcing fibre and matrix is a controlling element in composite performance. We deposited multi-walled carbon nanotubes ({MWCNTs)} onto electrically insulating glass fibre surfaces leading to the formation of semiconductive {MWCNT–glass} fibres and in turn multifunctional fibre/polymer interphases. The deposition process of {MWCNTs} onto glass fibre surfaces involved both electrophoretic deposition ({EPD)} and conventional dip coating methods. The {EPD} coating method produces a more homogeneous and continuous nanotube distribution on the glass fibre surface compared with the dip coating. According to fragmentation test results, the interphase with a small number of heterogeneous {MWCNTs} in the {EPD} fibre/epoxy composites, mimicking a biological bone structure, can remarkably improve the interfacial shear strength. We found that the semiconductive interphase results in a high sensitivity of the electrical resistance to the tensile strain of single glass fibre model
composites. This material provides a possible in situ mechanical load sensor and early warning of fibre composite damage.},

	abstract = {This work concerns the tensile properties of cement-based hybrid composites manufactured as: (i) sandwich composites that combine different layers of single fabric types; and (ii) hybrid composites, made from several yarn types within the same fabric. Hybrid combinations of low-modulus fabrics of polyethylene ({PE)} or polypropylene ({PP)} and high-modulus {AR} glass or aramid fabrics were prepared by the pultrusion process and tested in tension. Influence of pultrusion direction on the results was one of the parameters studied. It was found that hybrid composites made from {PE} and {AR} glass sustain strains better than 100\% {AR} glass composites, and are stronger than a single {PE} fabric composite. A hybrid fabric composites made with combination of high strength–high cost aramid and low stiffness–low cost {PP} yarns performed better than a single aramid fabric composite relative to their reinforcing volume contents. Results show that making hybrid composites is an attractive option for
cement-based elements. The performance of hybrid fabric composites is also influenced by the arrangement of fabric layers in the laminates. Composites with brittle and relatively strong fabrics (glass) at the mid-section and ductile fabrics ({PE)} near the surfaces of the composite performed better in tension than composites with the opposite arrangement.},

	volume = {95},
	abstract = {This paper presents the results of a study of fiber-cement hybrid composites containing high-performance continuous polyvinyl alcohol ({PVA)} fiber yarns or rovings. Two types of hybrid composites were constructed, using fiber combinations of {PVA} and glass (either continuous glass or 38 mm chopped strand), {PVA} and Fibrillated polypropylene networks. The tensile stress-strain behavior of these hybrids was studied, showing that the bibers, when used in a hybrid form, could result in superior composite performance compared to their individual fiber reinforced cements. The {PVA-} glass hybrid composite allowed similar or more favorable composite properties to be achieved at a lower addition of the high elongation fibers compared to polypropylene-glass hybrids. In comparison with the hybrids containing glass fibers (i.e., polypropylene glass, {PVA-glass)}, the {PVA-} polypropylene hybrid was less efficient at small strains (up to 1 percent), because of the high elongation of both fibers at small
strains. However, the {PVA} polypropylene combination was advantageous in achieving high-ultimate composite strength because the {PVA} and the polypropylene could simultaneously contribute to the composite strength and because of the synergistic interaction between the two reinforcing fibers.},

	abstract = {In this paper we compare three distinct asymptotic analyses for the probability distribution for strength of a certain class of fibrous materials. This class, which contains composite materials and twisted yarns and cables, is characterized by strong, mechanical interaction among neighboring fibers as is generated by a binding matrix or by transverse frictional forces. The model is the chain-of-bundles model, and we focus mainly on a planar geometry and a simple type of local load-sharing among fibers in a cross-section wherein the load of a failed fiber is shifted in equal portions to its two nearest flanking survivors. Through the study of typical examples we find that the results of the three methods all underscore the importance of the Weibull distribution for modeling composite strength, and are in excellent numerical agreement despite their differing analytical form. This is fortunate because only the two least accurate of the analyses show promise of being extended to more general three-
dimensional geometries and local load-sharing rules of interest in applications. The paper lays the groundwork for considering such extension in future papers.},

It presents a validation of the analytical model developed in the first part by providing comparisons between experimentally and analytically predicted pullout load curves of steel fibers embedded in cementitious matrices. Very good agreement is observed. The model is also used to derive, for the first time, bond shear stress versus slip curves typical of fiber-reinforced concrete and considered a constitutive property of the fiber-concrete interface. This has good practical significance since, while pullout tests of fibers are easy to conduct, there is currently no experimental method that directly yields their bond shear stress versus slip relationship.},
